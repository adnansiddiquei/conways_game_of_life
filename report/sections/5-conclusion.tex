\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this report, the performance of various algorithms to implement Conway's Game of Life was investigated.
Algorithms for neighbour counting and grid updating were discussed, and the performance of each was tested, arriving at
the conclusion that for this specific implementation, the simple convolution and lookup methods were the most efficient
for neighbour counting and grid updating respectively.
Furthermore, full grid-wise search of MPI rank and OMP thread combinations was performed on the Icelake node, and the best
performing combination found was 4 ranks with 19 nodes.
