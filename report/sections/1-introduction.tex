\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
This report details the process of planning, prototyping, developing, profiling and optimising a simulation for Conways
Game of Life.
Various algorithmic choices were explored, alongside varying implementations of MPI and OMP.
Memory constraints were ignored and the sole focus of this report was on optimising the simulation for speed.
